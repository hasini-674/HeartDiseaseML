# Multi-Dataset Heart Disease Prediction Project
This repository contains the implementation of various machine learning models to predict heart disease based on multiple datasets, including the Cardiovascular Dataset, Framingham Dataset and Heart Disease Dataset. The models aim to identify key risk factors contributing to heart disease and predict outcomes with high accuracy.
